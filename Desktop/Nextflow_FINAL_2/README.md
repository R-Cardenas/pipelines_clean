## Introduction

At UEA bob champion genomics we have developed a number of pipelines specialising in processing sequencing data. A number of pipelines are available for the processing of both RNA and DNA sequencing experiments - the pipelines can be used in different combinations depending on the nature of the analysis required. Below shows the pipelines that are currently working:

DNA:

  Exome:

  +-- Mapping and QC (cgpMAP)

    Germline:
      +-- Freebayes (variant calling)
      +-- GATK HaplotypeCaller

    Germline:
      +-- Freebayes (variant calling)
      +-- GATK HaplotypeCaller



The pipelines available are outline in the
requirements.
This document will outline the use of these pipelines, which is mainly
